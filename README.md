We present in this dashboard the first results of our analysis of Twitter data relating COVID. We analyze the mentions of COVID-related terms over time, and especially the mention of COVID symptoms. We note a strong correlation between the number of tweets including symptoms and the number of victims in Île-de-France (Paris region).

We collected tweets specifically from users in Île-de-France. We first used the Streaming API to identify users in the Paris area, and then collected the historic data from these users. This dashboard presents our analyses, based on 30,000 Twitter users, for a total of about 33 million tweets from December 2019. We exclude the retweets from this analysis which is now based on 17 million tweets.
